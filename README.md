# haegrilon-resourcepack
Resource pack for Haegriloncraft. It is a heavily modified version of Excalibur. Permission to share, modify and build on the pack has been granted by its creator Matt Dillow (Maffhew). All textures are either original pack textures, creations of Nicodemus or Tiuhtimymman, or contributions from other creators. Nothing has been taken without permission, but there might be old textures that we borrowed from some resourcepacks in the early days that we forgot about. Please notify us on discord immediately if you find anything like that and we will fix it.

Special thanks to Maffhew#3087, Markelow#3783, Brass_McCrafty#9353, GrandPappyJay#0794, Thamus_Knoward#2308 and other (I'm looking for names still) Minecraft creators for letting me use some of their textures.
